## Background & Research

I'm a computational biologist specializing in the development and application of bioinformatics methods to solve complex biological questions. My research sits at the intersection of evolutionary biology, genomics, and statistics, with a particular focus on understanding adaptive processes through computational approaches.

Currently, my research centers on two main areas:

- Developing robust statistical methods for handling missing data in quantitative genetics
- Investigating evolutionary patterns in threespine stickleback fish populations

## Technical Expertise

My work combines biological knowledge with computational skills to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets:

- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in R and Python for scientific computing and data analysis
- **Bioinformatics**: Experience with next-generation sequencing analysis, genome assembly, and comparative genomics
- **Statistical Methods**: Expertise in multivariate statistics, simulation modeling, and missing data imputation techniques
- **Pipeline Development**: Design of reproducible, modular workflows for processing biological data

## Education

- **M.S. in Bioinformatics** (2023-2025)  
    Loyola University Chicago
- **B.S. in Biology & B.S. in Bioinformatics** (2019-2023)  
    Loyola University Chicago  

## Beyond Research

When I'm not analyzing data or writing code, I'm deeply committed to the practice and instruction of Aikido. For the past 15 years, I've been practicing this Japanese martial art, and I've had the privilege of serving as an assistant instructor for the last decade. Aikido's principles of harmony and balance influence not just my physical practice but my approach to problem-solving in research as well.

I find balance in life by spending quality time outdoors. You'll often find me on the golf course with my fianc√©, working on my swing and enjoying friendly competition. When we're not golfing, we're likely taking long walks with our dog, exploring new trails and neighborhoods.
