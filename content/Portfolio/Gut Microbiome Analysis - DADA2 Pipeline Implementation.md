---

## Project Overview

This project involved the implementation of a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to analyze gut microbiome data from the Wastyk et al. 2021 study (PMID: 34256014). The pipeline focused on processing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data using the DADA2 methodology with a seamless handoff to phyloseq for robust statistical analysis and visualization.

The study investigated the effects of high-fiber versus high-fermented food diets on the gut microbiome, making this analysis particularly relevant for understanding dietary interventions and their impacts on human microbial communities.

### Problem & Solution

**The Challenge:** Raw 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data requires sophisticated processing to identify microbial taxa accurately. Traditional OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) clustering approaches often lack the resolution to detect fine-grained biological variation.

**The Solution:** I implemented a pipeline centered around DADA2 (Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2), which:

1. Employs a more precise ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) approach instead of OTUs
2. Provides single-nucleotide resolution for identifying bacterial taxa
3. Enables more accurate taxonomic assignments and diversity analyses
4. Integrates with phyloseq for streamlined statistical testing and visualization

This approach overcame common challenges in microbiome data analysis, such as sequencing errors, chimeric sequences, and taxonomic resolution limitations.

## Technical Implementation

The pipeline consisted of four main components:

### 1. Data Acquisition & Organization

- Created a script for automated downloading of sequencing files from the EBI database
- Implemented a systematic folder structure for organizing raw data, filtered data, results, and figures
- Linked sequencing files with participant demographic and clinical data for downstream analyses

### 2. Sequence Processing with DADA2

- Inspected sequence quality profiles to determine optimal trimming parameters
- Implemented primer removal using cutadapt
- Filtered low-quality reads and trimmed sequences to maintain high-quality bases
- Applied the DADA2 error model to learn sequencing error rates from the data
- Performed sample inference to identify true sequence variants
- Constructed ASV tables and removed chimeric sequences
- Tracked read counts throughout the pipeline to assess data quality

### 3. Taxonomic Classification

- Implemented taxonomic assignment using the DECIPHER method with the SILVA database
- Created a structured taxonomy table with domain to species-level classifications
- Handled unclassified taxa appropriately to prevent downstream analysis issues

### 4. Statistical Analysis & Visualization with phyloseq

- Constructed phyloseq objects integrating ASV data, taxonomy, and participant metadata
- Analyzed alpha diversity (Shannon, Simpson) across different demographic factors
- Performed ordination analysis using NMDS with Bray-Curtis distances
- Created barplots to visualize taxonomic composition by participant and treatment group
- Explored relationships between microbiome composition and dietary interventions

## Technologies Used

**Languages & Environments:**

- R (primary language for the entire pipeline)
- Bash (for data download and system commands)

**Key Libraries & Packages:**

- DADA2: Core algorithm for denoising and ASV identification
- phyloseq: Comprehensive framework for microbiome data analysis
- Biostrings: Biological sequence manipulation
- ShortRead: Processing of sequencing reads
- ggplot2: Publication-quality data visualization
- tidyverse: Data manipulation and analysis
- cutadapt: External tool for primer trimming

## Methodological Highlights

This project showcased several advanced bioinformatics approaches:

1. **ASV vs. OTU Approach**: Implemented the more modern ASV approach, which preserves biological variation that would be lost in traditional OTU clustering.
    
2. **Error Modeling**: Used DADA2's parametric error model to learn the error rates directly from the sequencing data, improving the accuracy of sequence variant identification.
    
3. **Taxonomy Assignment**: Employed the DECIPHER method, which uses a k-mer based approach combined with machine learning for more accurate taxonomic classification compared to traditional methods.
    
4. **Integration of Multiple Data Types**: Successfully merged sequence data with extensive participant metadata, enabling multifaceted analysis of relationships between microbiome composition and host factors.
    

## Outcomes & Impact

The implemented pipeline successfully:

- Processed hundreds of 16S rRNA amplicon samples from the study participants
- Identified thousands of unique bacterial ASVs with single-nucleotide resolution
- Revealed differences in microbial diversity and composition between dietary intervention groups
- Enabled analysis of relationships between microbiome features and participant demographics
- Created publication-quality visualizations for communicating complex microbiome data

The findings contributed to our understanding of how dietary interventions, particularly high-fiber and high-fermented food diets, influence the gut microbiome composition and diversity.

## Reflection

This project strengthened my expertise in microbiome data analysis and bioinformatics pipeline development. The implementation of the DADA2 approach provided valuable insights into the advantages of ASV-based methods over traditional OTU clustering for detecting fine-scale biological variation.

Working with this complex dataset improved my ability to process and analyze high-throughput sequencing data, perform robust statistical analyses, and generate meaningful biological insights from complex microbial communities. The integration with phyloseq demonstrated the power of combining specialized tools into a cohesive analytical framework.

The skills developed in this project are directly applicable to a wide range of microbiome studies across environmental, agricultural, and human health research domains.
