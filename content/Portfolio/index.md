Welcome to my portfolio. My work falls within the field of bioinformatics--the intersection of biology, statistics, and computer science. My current research focuses on quantitative genetics and evolutionary biology, with special interest in missing data methodologies and stickleback fish evolution (detailed [[Missing Data Handling in Quantitative Genetics - CCA vs MI|here]]). Below is a selection of projects that showcase my understanding of:
- Genomic analysis pipelines
- Statistical methods for biological data
- Microbiome data processing
- Evolutionary modeling and simulation
- Programming in R and Python
I invite you to explore these projects and discover how computational biology can transform raw data into scientific insights.
