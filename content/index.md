Welcome to my personal corner of the internet where I document my projects, thoughts, and journey. This site serves as both a portfolio of my work and a digital garden where ideas grow and evolve over time. This space is organized into three main sections:

### [[Portfolio/|Portfolio]]

This section showcases my portfolio of work. Here you'll find:

- Detailed documentation of completed projects
- Works in progress
- Technical skills and technologies I've worked with
- Case studies and problem-solving approaches

> [!tip] Looking for my work? The Projects section highlights my technical capabilities and creative solutions. Each project includes background, implementation details, and outcomes.

### [[about-me|About Me]]

The About Me page offers insights into who I am beyond the code and projects:

- My professional background and journey
- Values and approach to work
- Education and learning path
- Contact information and professional links

> [!info] Want to know more about me? Learn about my background, interests, and the path that led me to where I am today.

### [[Digital Garden/|Digital Garden]]

My Digital Garden is where I cultivate ideas, notes, and learning in public:

- Technical notes and tutorials
- Concept explorations and learning journeys
- Reflections and thought pieces
- Resource collections and knowledge bases

> [!note] What's a Digital Garden? Unlike traditional blogs with chronological posts, a digital garden is an interconnected collection of notes that grow and evolve over time. Feel free to explore the connections between ideas!
